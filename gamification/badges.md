# Badges on Decidim

## Challenge
The current badge system is quite limited, offering only generic badges that cannot be modified, added, or removed by the organization. More personalized and meaningful badges could materialize the expected positive outcomes of gamification of participation.

## Solution
An enhanced badge system where we can create new badges, modify existing ones, and activate or deactivate them as needed. This would make the experience more rewarding and tailored to the community.
The admin could create badges and define at what conditions they are assigned. Potentially some badges could be specific to some participatory spaces or components.

### Inspiration
- Stack Overflow's badge system - Organizes badges into categories (Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on difficulty and offers clear paths to achievement

- GitHub's achievement system - Badges for specific contributions and milestones that celebrate user activity

- [Open Badges standard](https://openbadges.org/) - Would be interesting to try making it interoperable with the standard

### User stories

As an administrator:
- I want to create custom badges with unique names, descriptions, and icons so I can tailor recognition to my community's goals
- I want to set specific conditions for badge achievement (e.g., number of proposals created, comments posted, votes cast) so badges are awarded automatically
- I want to create badge series for specific initiatives or campaigns so I can drive participation toward strategic goals
- I want to activate badges for specific participatory spaces only so I can run temporary campaigns

As a participant:
- I want to see which badges I've earned and which are available to earn so I understand my progress
- I want to receive notifications when I earn a badge so I feel recognized
- I want to display my badges on my public profile so others can see my contributions
- I want to understand how to earn each badge so I know what actions to take
